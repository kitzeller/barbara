# Barbara

Barbara is a novel live coding interface that enables users to design languages for visual geometric pattern generation. 
Inspired by algorithmic quilting patterns, Barbara helps users construct languages that mimic real-world quilting procedures 
which can be used for both live coding performance or digital quilt recreation. Users create languages and patterns in 
Barbaraâ€™s online coding environment with the Parsing Expression Grammar language formalism; the resulting patterns can 
be freely shared, remixed, and combined into new quilts. As a push towards the applications of language-oriented design, 
we created Barbara to broaden access to the power of computational media and the beauty of quilting for both programmers 
and quilters alike. Barbara is free and open-source software.

## Local Development Server

In order to create a local development server, clone this repo. You will need to have a local instance of [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) running. 

Then create a `.env` file in the root folder and add the connection string. If you have named the database barbara, this may look like `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/barbara`.

You can then run the server using `npm start`.
