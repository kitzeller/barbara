## Repo Structure

- [diary](diary.md) is a "research"/progress diary for ideas and updates on the project that should be expressed in somewhat formal writing rather than TODO comments on code
- [knowledge](knowledge.md) is a "knowledge-base" for referencing definitions and good things to know so we don't have to dig through the diary
- [papers](papers) directory contains the formal papers and resources referenced by this project
- [public](public) directory contains the vm code
- [models](models) directory contains the mongodb model schemas
- [svg](svg) directory contains some svg code (basically just me messing about)
